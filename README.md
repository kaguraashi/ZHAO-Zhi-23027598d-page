# Project Reflection
In this exercise, I built and successfully deployed my personal website from scratch using GitHub: I first created a repository and developed it in Codespaces. I wrote a well-structured aboutme.md file to organize my profile, skills, projects, and contact information. After uploading my profile picture, I used Copilot Agent Mode to generate index.html, styles.css, and script.js based on aboutme.md in Agent Mode. I implemented responsive design with Tailwind CSS, previewed the layout and images with Live Server, then committed and pushed via Git. Finally, I enabled GitHub Pages in Settings → Pages, triggering automatic deployment through GitHub Actions. What I gained wasn't just “writing web pages,” but more importantly, completing the full delivery pipeline: coding → version control → automation → publishing. I also gained a deeper understanding of the value of traceability and rollback in commits. The overall experience closely resembled real engineering work, as the most time-consuming part was verifying that the final result was “deliverable, presentable, and error-free.” This included checking if the email link was up-to-date and ensuring filenames and image paths were consistent in letter case. AI's strengths lie in rapid generation, end-to-end structural frameworks, and clear section organization. However, it may lack precision in details and copywriting, and path-related naming errors can occur, requiring manual proofreading and polishing. My most effective approach is to first draft a clear “blueprint” in aboutme.md, then provide explicit constraints to the AI (read this file, generate the three-piece set, use Tailwind, implement responsiveness). I then iterate in small steps, modifying one item at a time. This is more stable than a single major overhaul and makes changes easier to validate. It has also deepened my understanding of agile development and iterative delivery concepts, and their importance.
